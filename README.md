## My process

I looked at the sample design multiple times to be able to closely design a copy of it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned about the 'hover' CSS property.
It is what I used to make the card have a shadow once the cursor is placed on it.

```CSS
header:hover {
    box-shadow: 5px 5px;
    border: solid 1px;
}
```

### Continued development

I still need to learn more about CSS, especially Flexbox and Grid.
